## Decision history (highlights from DECISION_LOG.md)

- DEC-016: No free tier (sub-only)
- DEC-017: 8 base lifts CV-coaching scope (chosen quality over breadth)
- DEC-018: ED-screening non-skippable (clinical-safety HARD VETO)
- DEC-021: No Russian language UI у v1.0
- DEC-023: Geo-pricing $9 UA / $19 Western

28 total documented decisions з reverse-cost assessment.

---

## What's working well

1. **Documentation discipline.** Every decision logged. Every doc versioned. Every tag pushed.
2. **Brand consistency.** Editorial-brutalist aesthetic holds across 12 HTML pages.
3. **Safety-first design.** clinical-safety VETO has shaped many decisions positively.
4. **Operational thinking.** Не just product — full operational playbook (support, ops, B2B, hiring, legal, finance).
5. **Build-in-public.** Public repo з transparent decision-making.

---

## What's worrying

1. **Zero code shipped.** All strategy, no engineering yet. Founding Engineer hire critical.
2. **Zero validated users.** 30 interviews planned but not conducted.
3. **CV-quality unknown.** Technical bet not validated.
4. **No revenue.** Pre-seed, runway = personal savings.
5. **Solo founder bottleneck.** Many critical decisions concentrated.

---

## What's next (immediate)

- [x] Careers page live → `jobs.html` (shareable URL for FE + DL hiring)
- [ ] Apply Founding Engineer + Design Lead JDs on platforms (Djinni, DOU, LinkedIn, Wellfound)
- [ ] Domain form.coach registered
- [ ] Twitter / X account з first posts
- [ ] Schedule 5 first user interviews
- [ ] Configure Beehiiv newsletter (гайд у docs/NEWSLETTER.md)
