## Active constraints (HARD)

- `clinical-safety` HARD VETO on all food/body/pain/mental health content
- Audit log: append-only HMAC-chained (DEC-030)
- No social features in app (DEC-002)
- Streak grace after 2 misses, not 1 (DEC-013)
- Editorial-brutalist tone, no «дисципліна — свобода» (DEC-007, DEC-014)
- External sharing: clinical-safety gate (DEC-029)
