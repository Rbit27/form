## Active constraints (HARD)

- `clinical-safety` HARD VETO on all food/body/pain/mental health content
- Audit log: append-only HMAC-chained (DEC-030)
- No social features in app (DEC-002)
- Streak grace after 2 misses, not 1 (DEC-013)
- Editorial-brutalist tone, no «дисципліна — свобода» (DEC-007, DEC-014)
- External sharing: clinical-safety gate (DEC-029)

---

## Next priorities

- Review posts 586–600 (sports-scientist pass before publish)
- newsletter-04.md — drafted v4.22.0, needs editorial review before send
- MOBILE_ROADMAP.md update (platform-engineer)
- PIA filing for readiness_bucket PostHog (compliance-officer — DEC-046 pre-condition)
- PostHog DPA review (compliance-officer — DEC-046 pre-condition)
- Continue block 601–650: post-607+ (next topics TBD — see content roadmap in README)
- post-605 (block vs. wave vs. linear periodization) — review_pending: sports-scientist
- post-606 (shift work / travel adaptation) — review_pending: sports-scientist
