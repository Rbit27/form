## 1. Purpose

This document models the cost of delivering FORM to one user for one month, segmented by pricing tier. It exists to:

- Give the founder a defensible answer to "what does a user cost us?" before Series A diligence
- Surface the highest-leverage cost reduction levers (currently: Anthropic API and ElevenLabs)
- Set gross margin targets that investors in AI-native consumer SaaS will benchmark against
- Track how unit economics improve (or deteriorate) as volume scales

This is a **model, not actuals**. Every line is marked [ESTIMATE] until replaced with a reconciled invoice figure. The first real cost data will come from the closed beta cohort. Until then, treat all numbers as planning inputs, not commitments.

Cross-references: `docs/FINANCIALS.md` (revenue projections), `docs/METRICS.md` (W-ACSU, activation funnel), `docs/ENTERPRISE.md` (B2B pricing), `docs/ASSUMPTIONS_REGISTER.md` (what we are still testing).

---

## 2. Assumptions and Methodology

### 2.1 Baseline behavioral assumptions

These drive every cost line. If behavior deviates, recalculate from here.

| Assumption | Free tier | Pro tier | Enterprise seat | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Weekly active sessions (WAU) | 1.5 [ESTIMATE] | 3.5 [ESTIMATE] | 3.0 [ESTIMATE] | Target W-ACSU from METRICS.md; free users less engaged |
| Sessions per month (× 4.3 weeks) | 6.5 | 15.1 | 12.9 | Derived |
| Avg tokens input per session (Anthropic) | 2,000 [ESTIMATE] | 2,000 [ESTIMATE] | 2,000 [ESTIMATE] | Prompt = system context ~1,200 + user turn ~500 + history ~300 |
| Avg tokens output per session (Anthropic) | 500 [ESTIMATE] | 500 [ESTIMATE] | 500 [ESTIMATE] | Coaching cue + plan update; Victor is concise by design |
| Voice (ElevenLabs) adoption | 10% [ESTIMATE] | 40% [ESTIMATE] | 35% [ESTIMATE] | Free users hit quota cap faster; Pro users more likely to enable |
| Avg voice chars per voice-enabled session | 800 [ESTIMATE] | 1,200 [ESTIMATE] | 1,000 [ESTIMATE] | Coaching cues only; not full narration |
| Supabase storage per user (MB) | 15 | 80 | 60 | Workout history, meal logs, CV pose snapshots (thumbnails only) |
| Cloudflare Workers requests per session | 12 [ESTIMATE] | 18 [ESTIMATE] | 16 [ESTIMATE] | Auth, sync, LLM proxy, push, 2-3 read endpoints per session |
| Sentry/PostHog amortized user base (M12) | 5,000 MAU | 5,000 MAU | 5,000 MAU | Shared infra; amortized across all users |

### 2.2 Pricing inputs used

| Vendor | Rate | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Anthropic Claude Sonnet-class | $3.00 / 1M input tokens, $15.00 / 1M output tokens | Current list price; no volume discount assumed pre-Series A |
| ElevenLabs | $0.30 / 1,000 characters | Creator/Business tier estimated; free tier has monthly cap |
| Supabase | $25/month Pro plan (up to 8 GB DB, 250 GB bandwidth) | Amortized across active users; switches from $0 free tier at ~500 MAU |
| Cloudflare Workers | $0.50 / 1M requests (above free 100k/day) | Workers Paid plan $5/month base included in fixed overhead |
| Sentry | ~$26/month Team plan | Amortized; covers up to ~50k events/day |
| PostHog | Free up to 1M events/month, then ~$0.00031/event | Amortized at 5k MAU × ~200 events/user/month ≈ 1M events → near-free |
| Apple/Google IAP | 30% standard; 15% Small Business Program (<$1M annual revenue) | Applies to consumer tiers only; enterprise is direct invoice |

### 2.3 What this model does not include

- **Human support labor** — ops allocation (~$0.50–0.70/user/month at scale) is noted in FINANCIALS.md but excluded here to isolate infrastructure COGS
- **R&D / CV pipeline inference** — on-device; no marginal cloud cost per user
- **CDN bandwidth for static assets** — covered by Cloudflare free tier at current scale
- **Idle compute** — Supabase and Workers have effectively zero idle cost at this architecture

---

## 3. COGS Breakdown per Tier

All figures are **per user per month**. [ESTIMATE] on every line until replaced with invoice data.

### 3.1 Anthropic API cost calculation

```
Input cost  = (tokens_input_per_session × sessions_per_month × $3.00) / 1,000,000
Output cost = (tokens_output_per_session × sessions_per_month × $15.00) / 1,000,000
```

| Tier | Sessions/month | Input tokens total | Input cost | Output tokens total | Output cost | Total API cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Free | 6.5 | 13,000 | $0.039 | 3,250 | $0.049 | **$0.088** |
| Pro | 15.1 | 30,200 | $0.091 | 7,550 | $0.113 | **$0.204** |
| Enterprise | 12.9 | 25,800 | $0.077 | 6,450 | $0.097 | **$0.174** |

### 3.2 ElevenLabs voice cost calculation

```
Voice cost = voice_adoption_rate × sessions_per_month × avg_chars_per_session × ($0.30 / 1,000)
```

| Tier | Adoption | Chars/session | Sessions/month | Monthly voice cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Free | 10% | 800 | 6.5 | **$0.016** |
| Pro | 40% | 1,200 | 15.1 | **$0.218** |
| Enterprise | 35% | 1,000 | 12.9 | **$0.135** |

### 3.3 Full COGS table

| Cost item | Free user/month | Pro user/month | Enterprise seat/month |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Anthropic API** [ESTIMATE] | $0.09 | $0.20 | $0.17 |
| **ElevenLabs voice** [ESTIMATE] | $0.02 | $0.22 | $0.14 |
| **Supabase** (compute + storage + bandwidth, amortized) [ESTIMATE] | $0.01 | $0.05 | $0.04 |
| **Cloudflare Workers** (requests, amortized) [ESTIMATE] | $0.01 | $0.02 | $0.02 |
| **Sentry** (amortized at 5k MAU) [ESTIMATE] | $0.005 | $0.005 | $0.005 |
| **PostHog** (amortized, near-free tier) [ESTIMATE] | $0.002 | $0.002 | $0.002 |
| **Total infrastructure COGS** | **$0.13** | **$0.50** | **$0.34** |

### 3.4 COGS notes

**Free tier:** Cost is minimal because sessions are fewer and voice adoption is low. The business risk is not cost-per-user but conversion rate — a free user who never converts to Pro is $0.13/month of pure cost with no revenue offset. Free tier must be designed to drive activation, not just engagement.

**Pro tier:** Anthropic API and ElevenLabs together account for ~84% of infrastructure COGS. This is the primary lever to manage. Prompt engineering, caching, and model tiering (Haiku for classification, Sonnet for coaching turns) can materially reduce this.

**Enterprise seat:** Slightly lower than Pro due to modeled lower session frequency (enterprise users may log workouts less consistently than self-motivated Pro subscribers) and lower voice adoption assumption. Direct billing eliminates app store fees.

---

## 4. Unit Economics Summary

| Metric | Free | Pro | Enterprise seat |
|---|---|---|---|
| ARPU (monthly) | $0 | $19.00 (Western) | $30.00 [ESTIMATE, midpoint of $25–35 range] |
| App store fee (15% SBP / 30% standard) | — | $2.85 (15%) → $5.70 (30%) | $0 (direct invoice) |
| Net revenue after store fee | $0 | $13.30–$16.15 | $30.00 |
| Infrastructure COGS/user/month | $0.13 | $0.50 | $0.34 |
| Gross profit/user/month | -$0.13 | $12.80–$15.65 | $29.66 |
| Gross margin % | n/a (no revenue) | 67.4%–82.4% | 98.9% |
| Contribution margin (after COGS + store fee) | -$0.13 | $12.80–$15.65 | $29.66 |

**Gross margin range on Pro** reflects App Store fee uncertainty: 15% Small Business Program applies while annual revenue is below $1M; transitions to 30% above that threshold. See Section 9.

**Geo-pricing note:** ARPU above is the primary Western market price ($19/month). UA/EE/PL geo-pricing ($9/month) applies where App Store detects those regions; at $9 ARPU with SBP 15%, infrastructure gross margin = ($9 × 0.85 − $0.50) / $9 = 79.4%. Enterprise deals in all geographies are billed direct at $6–12/seat/month, independent of consumer geo-pricing.

**Enterprise gross margin** is extremely high on COGS alone because the per-seat API cost is low relative to ACV. The real cost of enterprise is implementation and customer success labor, which is modeled in Section 8 and excluded from this infrastructure COGS table by design.

## 5. Break-Even Analysis

### 5.1 Fixed monthly infrastructure overhead

These costs exist regardless of user count (at launch scale):

| Item | Monthly cost |
|---|---|
| Supabase Pro plan | $25 |
| Cloudflare Workers Paid base | $5 |
| Sentry Team plan | $26 |
| PostHog (within free tier at launch) | $0 |
| **Total fixed overhead** | **$56/month** |

### 5.2 Break-even formula

```
Break-even Pro subscribers =
    Fixed overhead / (Net revenue per Pro user - Variable COGS per Pro user)

= $56 / ($16.15 - $0.50)    [using Western $19 ARPU, 15% SBP app store rate]
= $56 / $15.65
= ~4 Pro subscribers to cover fixed overhead
```

At 30% app store fee:

```
= $56 / ($13.30 - $0.50)
= $56 / $12.80
= ~5 Pro subscribers
```

**Interpretation:** Fixed infrastructure overhead is negligible. The real break-even question for FORM is not "how many users to cover servers" but "how many Pro subscribers to cover total burn" — which includes team salaries and is modeled in `docs/FINANCIALS.md`. Infrastructure break-even is effectively solved by a handful of subscribers.

### 5.3 Burn-rate break-even (for reference)

From FINANCIALS.md, target burn at launch is ~$80k/month. At $15.65 net contribution per Pro user (Western $19 ARPU, SBP 15%):

```
Pro subscribers needed to break even on full burn = $80,000 / $15.65 ≈ 5,112 Pro subscribers
```

This is the number that matters operationally.

## 6. Gross Margin Targets

### 6.1 Industry benchmarks

| Company / category | Reported gross margin | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Calm | ~55% [ESTIMATE, public reports] | Consumer subscription, content-heavy |
| Noom | ~60% [ESTIMATE] | AI-assisted coaching, human coach layer |
| Whoop | ~45% [ESTIMATE] | Hardware + software mix; hardware drags margin |
| Pure SaaS median | 70–80% | Software only, no AI inference cost |
| AI-native SaaS (early stage) | 50–70% [ESTIMATE] | API costs before volume discounts |
| **FORM target (Pro, post-SBP)** | **75–85%** | After app store fees, before support labor; Western $19 ARPU |
| **FORM target (Enterprise)** | **>85%** | After implementation cost, on mature accounts |

### 6.2 FORM gross margin path

| Phase | Pro GM % | Driver |
|---|---|---|
| Beta (0–500 users) | ~79% | Western $19 ARPU, SBP 15% fee, ~$0.70/user support allocation, no volume discounts |
| Launch (500–5k users) | ~79–82% | SBP holds; prompt caching begins to reduce Anthropic cost |
| Growth (5k–50k users) | ~82–85% | Volume pricing discussions with Anthropic; PostHog moves to paid tier |
| Scale (50k+ users) | ~84–87% | Committed spend discounts; model fine-tuning reduces token usage; support cost amortized |

**Note on the 78% figure in FINANCIALS.md:** That figure is gross margin before App Store fees, which is a legitimate SaaS accounting presentation (treating store fees as a distribution cost rather than COGS). At Western $19 ARPU, after 15% SBP store fees, the realized margin is 63–69% (infrastructure COGS + support labor blended). Both figures will be disclosed transparently in investor materials, labeled appropriately.

## 7. Scaling Economics

### 7.1 How per-user COGS changes with scale

| User count (Pro MAU) | Anthropic cost/user | ElevenLabs cost/user | Supabase cost/user | Total COGS/user | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1,000 | $0.20 | $0.22 | $0.05 | $0.50 | List pricing; no discounts |
| 10,000 | $0.18 [ESTIMATE] | $0.20 [ESTIMATE] | $0.04 | $0.45 | Anthropic committed spend tier likely; Supabase scales smoothly |
| 100,000 | $0.13 [ESTIMATE] | $0.15 [ESTIMATE] | $0.03 | $0.33 | Volume discounts negotiated; caching hit rate improves; model tiering mature |

### 7.2 Key scaling levers

**Anthropic API — highest impact**

- **Prompt caching:** Anthropic supports caching of static system prompt content. Victor's base persona + safety rules + exercise library context (~800 tokens) can be cached, reducing effective input cost by ~35–40% on the static portion. [ESTIMATE: reduces total API cost by $0.03–0.06/user/month at current usage]
- **Model tiering:** Use Claude Haiku (significantly cheaper) for intent classification, set selection, and simple acknowledgments. Reserve Sonnet for actual coaching turns and program adaptation. [ESTIMATE: reduces API cost by 20–30% if 50% of calls route to Haiku]
- **Committed spend discounts:** Anthropic offers volume pricing at meaningful scale. Negotiations typically begin around $50k–100k/month in API spend, which FORM reaches at roughly 30k–50k active Pro users at current usage rates. [ESTIMATE]

**ElevenLabs — second highest impact**

- **Audio caching:** Pre-generate and cache common coaching cues ("Good depth on that squat", "Elbows up", "Brace your core"). The long tail of Victor's vocabulary is finite. [ESTIMATE: 60–70% of voice output is cacheable common cues, reducing effective voice cost by ~50%]
- **Tier upgrade economics:** ElevenLabs Business/Enterprise tiers offer better per-character rates at volume. The crossover depends on negotiated terms.

**Supabase — low impact, well-contained**

- Supabase Pro ($25/month) handles up to 8 GB database and 250 GB bandwidth — sufficient for ~10k–15k MAU at current data model. At higher scale, upgrade to Team or Enterprise plan. Cost per user drops at scale because the fixed plan cost is amortized across more users.
- Read replica usage for analytics queries (instead of hitting primary) prevents compute cost from spiking during dashboard loads.

**PostHog — crosses into paid at ~1M events/month**

- At 5k MAU × ~200 events/user/month = 1M events — right at the free tier boundary.
- At 10k MAU: ~2M events, estimated $310/month additional. Amortized cost: $0.031/user/month. Still negligible.
- At 100k MAU: ~20M events, estimated ~$5,500/month. Amortized: $0.055/user/month. Material but manageable.

## 8. Enterprise Economics

### 8.1 Revenue and COGS per enterprise deal

Minimum deal size: 20 seats at $25–35/seat/month = $500–700/month per deal, billed annually = $6,000–8,400 ACV.

| Metric | Min deal (20 seats, $25/seat) | Mid deal (100 seats, $30/seat) | Large deal (500 seats, $35/seat) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Monthly recurring revenue | $500 | $3,000 | $17,500 |
| Annual contract value (ACV) | $6,000 | $36,000 | $210,000 |
| Monthly infrastructure COGS (@ $0.34/seat) | $6.80 | $102 | $595 |
| Infrastructure gross margin | 98.6% | 96.6% | 96.6% |

### 8.2 Implementation and onboarding cost

Enterprise deals carry one-time and recurring non-infrastructure costs that consumer tiers do not:

| Cost item | One-time per deal | Ongoing per month | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| SSO/SCIM integration and testing | $800–1,500 [ESTIMATE] | $0 | Engineering time; amortizes across deal life |
| Admin dashboard onboarding and training | $200–400 [ESTIMATE] | $0 | Customer success time |
| Custom SLA / compliance review | $300–800 [ESTIMATE] | $0 | Legal + compliance-officer time; lower for repeat buyer type |
| Dedicated CSM time (ongoing) | — | $150–400 [ESTIMATE] | Scales with seat count; ~2 hrs/month per account at mid-size |
| **Total implementation (mid deal)** | **~$1,500** | **~$250** | Payback on $36k ACV deal: < 2 months |

### 8.3 Minimum viable enterprise deal

For enterprise to be worth the GTM motion at this stage:

```
Minimum ACV to justify sales + implementation overhead: ~$12,000/year [ESTIMATE]
= 100 seats at $10/seat/month (floor), or
= 40 seats at $25/seat/month (our floor pricing)
```

Deals below 20 seats are currently declined — the implementation overhead is not recoverable. This threshold is reviewed when enterprise sales tooling matures (post-Series A).

### 8.4 Enterprise vs. consumer margin comparison

| | Pro consumer | Enterprise (mid deal) |
|---|---|---|
| ARPU | $19/month (Western) | $30/seat/month |
| Store fee | 15–30% | 0% |
| Infra COGS | $0.50 | $0.34 |
| Support/CS allocation | ~$0.70 [ESTIMATE] | ~$3.00 [ESTIMATE] (dedicated CSM) |
| **Net contribution margin** | ~$12.10–14.95 | ~$26.66 |
| **Net margin %** | ~64–79% | ~89% |

Enterprise wins on margin even with dedicated CS, because the direct billing relationship eliminates the App Store tax entirely.

### 8.5 Enterprise CAC Model

Enterprise CAC is the all-in cost to acquire one signed deal: marketing attribution, sales time, and pre-sales technical work. Unlike consumer CAC (driven by paid acquisition), enterprise CAC is driven by human time.

| Cost item | Small deal (20 seats) | Mid deal (100 seats) | Large deal (500 seats) |
|---|---|---|---|
| SDR/AE outreach and qualification | $400–600 (founder-led) | $1,500–2,500 (AE at $120k OTE, 20 deals/year) | $3,500–6,000 (AE + SDR) |
| Technical evaluation / POC | $300–500 (0.5–1 eng day) | $800–1,500 (1.5–3 eng days) | $2,000–4,000 (3–6 eng days) |
| Legal and compliance review | $200–400 | $500–800 | $1,500–3,000 |
| Content and outreach (amortized) | $100–200 | $300–500 | $500–1,000 |
| **Total enterprise CAC [ESTIMATE]** | **$1,000–1,700** | **$3,100–5,300** | **$7,500–14,000** |

Notes:
- **Founder-led sales (pre-PMF):** No explicit AE cash cost. Founder time has opportunity cost but is not a cash outflow. Small-deal cash CAC at this stage: $500–800.
- **Post-PMF AE-led:** The $1,500–2,500 AE cost on mid deals assumes 20 closed deals/year per AE at $120k total compensation. Adjust as actual close rates emerge.
- All figures [ESTIMATE] until first 3 enterprise deals are time-tracked. See OQ-08.

### 8.6 Enterprise LTV/CAC Analysis

LTV = ACV × average contract life × gross margin. Enterprise average contract life: **3 years** [ESTIMATE — typical for corporate wellness; replace post-M12].

| Deal size | ACV | LTV (3yr × 89% GM) | CAC (midpoint) | LTV/CAC | Payback period |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Small (20 seats) | $6,000 | $16,020 | $1,350 | **11.9×** | ~3 months |
| Mid (100 seats) | $36,000 | $96,120 | $4,200 | **22.9×** | ~1.7 months |
| Large (500 seats) | $210,000 | $560,700 | $10,750 | **52.2×** | ~0.6 months |

All three deal sizes deliver LTV/CAC ratios well above the conventional 3:1 benchmark for B2B SaaS. Even the minimum 20-seat deal returns ~12× CAC over the contract life. Economics improve dramatically at scale, justifying investment in enterprise GTM once consumer PMF is validated.

**Caveat:** These ratios assume 89% net margin from §8.4. If CS cost scales above modeled levels (e.g., dedicated CSM per account below 50 seats), small-deal margin degrades. The 40-seat minimum threshold in §8.3 exists precisely to protect this.

### 8.7 Expansion and Churn Economics

Enterprise value is not initial ACV alone — it is expansion potential and net revenue retention (NRR).

**NRR model — cohort of 10 mid deals ($360k starting ARR):**

| Scenario | Year 2 ARR | NRR | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pessimistic: 20% logo churn, 0% expansion | $288,000 | 80% | High early-churn; no land-and-expand |
| Baseline: 10% logo churn, 15% seat expansion | $378,000 | 105% | Modest organic growth offsets some churn |
| Optimistic: 5% logo churn, 30% seat expansion | $421,200 | 117% | Strong adoption → org-wide rollout |

**Expansion triggers:**
- Initial purchase = one department or team. Natural expansion = company-wide rollout.
- 20-seat pilot with proven adoption → 100-seat renewal is a 5× ACV expansion.
- New office locations, shift cohorts, or acquired subsidiaries as additional seat blocks.
- Enterprise SSO/SCIM integration (see `docs/SSO_SCIM_IMPLEMENTATION.md`) makes org-wide expansion frictionless once IdP is established — no individual onboarding per new employee.

**Churn signals to monitor:**
- Champion departure (HR lead or wellness coordinator who bought) — highest logo-churn risk
- Seat utilization below 30% by M3 — leading indicator; trigger a CS engagement
- Budget cycle reset (wellness budgets often reviewed in Q4)
- M&A activity at client company

**Investor benchmark context:** Series A enterprise SaaS targets NRR >110%. Series B targets >120%. Baseline scenario (105%) is below Series A target — validating that expansion motion is a first-class product and CS priority from day one.

### 8.8 Year 1 vs. Year 2+ Deal Economics

Implementation cost is front-loaded; from Year 2, the same deal generates higher net margin because setup is fully amortized.

| Metric | Year 1 (mid deal, 100 seats) | Year 2+ (same deal, no expansion) |
|---|---|---|
| ACV | $36,000 | $36,000 |
| Infrastructure COGS (@$0.34/seat/month × 12) | $408 | $408 |
| Implementation cost (one-time) | $1,500 | $0 |
| CSM cost ($250/month × 12) | $3,000 | $3,000 |
| **Total cost** | **$4,908** | **$3,408** |
| **Net margin** | **$31,092 (86.4%)** | **$32,592 (90.5%)** |
| Y2 margin improvement vs Y1 | — | **+4.1 pp** |

**Multi-year contract strategy:** A 5–8% discount on 2-year or 3-year prepayment improves cash flow and locks in renewal. The Year 2+ efficiency gain (+4.1 pp margin) more than offsets the discount on most deal sizes. Standard practice on deals >50 seats; offer proactively in enterprise negotiations.

## 9. App Store Tax Impact

### 9.1 Fee structure

| Scenario | Apple fee | Google fee | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Standard (>$1M annual revenue) | 30% | 30% | Default |
| Small Business Program (<$1M annual revenue) | 15% | 15% | Applies from day one if enrolled; Apple resets to 30% when you cross $1M |
| Web billing (direct Stripe) | ~2.9% + $0.30 | ~2.9% + $0.30 | Payment processing only; no platform tax |
| Enterprise direct invoice | ~0.5–1% | ~0.5–1% | Wire/ACH; minimal processing cost |

### 9.2 Impact on Pro user economics

| Billing path | ARPU | Store/processing fee | Net revenue | Infra COGS | Gross profit | GM% |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Apple IAP (SBP, 15%) | $19.00 | $2.85 | $16.15 | $0.50 | $15.65 | 82.4% |
| Apple IAP (standard, 30%) | $19.00 | $5.70 | $13.30 | $0.50 | $12.80 | 67.4% |
| Web billing (Stripe) | $19.00 | $0.85 | $18.15 | $0.50 | $17.65 | 92.9% |

### 9.3 Strategy

**Near-term (pre-$1M ARR):** Enroll in Small Business Program immediately on launch. 15% fee is the baseline. This is straightforward and material — the difference between 15% and 30% is $2.25/user/month, or roughly $27/year. On 5,000 Pro users that is $135k/year in additional margin.

**Web billing alternative:** iOS App Store guidelines prohibit directing users to external purchase flows from within the app (anti-steering rules), but the Epic v. Apple ruling (US) and EU Digital Markets Act create openings. Monitor legal landscape. If web billing becomes viable in primary markets, a direct Stripe billing path at $19/month could recover ~$2.00–4.85/user/month vs. IAP.

**Annual plan uplift:** Annual plans paid upfront ($120–144/year depending on discount offered) improve cash flow and reduce churn. App store fees still apply, but the timing benefit is material for a capital-light pre-Series A company.

**Enterprise billing:** All enterprise deals are invoiced directly (wire, ACH, or credit card via Stripe). No app store involvement. This is one of the structural margin advantages of B2B revenue.

## 10. Sensitivity Analysis

### 10.1 Anthropic API cost doubles (2× current pricing)

**Scenario:** Anthropic raises prices, or FORM's token usage increases due to longer context windows or feature expansion.

| Metric | Baseline | 2× API cost | Delta |
|---|---|---|---|
| API cost/Pro user/month | $0.20 | $0.41 | +$0.21 |
| Total COGS/Pro user | $0.50 | $0.71 | +$0.21 |
| Gross profit/Pro user (SBP) | $15.65 | $15.44 | -$0.21 |
| Gross margin % (SBP) | 82.4% | 81.3% | -1.1 pp |

**Assessment:** Surprisingly low impact at current usage. Even a 2× price increase only moves gross margin ~1.4 percentage points because API cost is a small fraction of ARPU at Pro pricing. The model is robust to Anthropic price increases at this ARPU level.

**The real risk** is not price, it is usage: if Pro users average 25+ sessions/month instead of 15 (i.e., W-ACSU of 6+ instead of 3.5), API cost doubles from usage alone, not from pricing. Impose soft usage metering on free tier; monitor Pro usage closely.

### 10.2 Voice adoption 80% vs. 20% (Pro tier)

| Scenario | Voice adoption | Voice cost/user/month | Total COGS | Gross margin % (SBP) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Low adoption | 20% | $0.11 | $0.39 | 83.0% |
| Baseline | 40% | $0.22 | $0.50 | 82.4% |
| High adoption | 80% | $0.43 | $0.71 | 81.3% |

**Assessment:** Voice adoption at 80% adds ~$0.21/user/month vs. 20% baseline — similar in magnitude to a 2× Anthropic price increase. The margin impact is manageable.

**However:** If voice adoption drives meaningfully higher retention (hypothesis: voice coaching is stickier), the LTV impact of high voice adoption likely outweighs its cost. Do not optimize voice adoption down purely on a cost basis without measuring the retention correlation.

**Mitigation:** Audio caching of common cues (see Section 7.2) changes the economics significantly. With 60% cache hit rate, effective cost at 80% adoption is ~$0.17/user/month — lower than the baseline uncached 40% adoption scenario.

### 10.3 Combined stress scenario: 2× Anthropic + 80% voice adoption (uncached)

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| API cost/Pro user | $0.41 |
| Voice cost/Pro user | $0.43 |
| Total COGS | $0.92 |
| Gross profit/Pro user (SBP) | $15.23 |
| Gross margin % | 80.2% |

Even under this combined worst case, gross margin stays above 80% at the SBP rate. The model is structurally healthy at current ARPU levels. The model breaks if ARPU drops significantly (e.g., heavy discounting or geo mix shift toward lower-price markets), not from API costs.

### 10.4 Supabase scaling inflection

Supabase Pro ($25/month) is sufficient through approximately 10,000–15,000 MAU. At higher scale:

| MAU | Supabase plan | Monthly cost | Cost/user |
|---|---|---|---|
| < 500 | Free | $0 | $0 |
| 500–15,000 | Pro | $25 | $0.002–$0.05 |
| 15,000–50,000 | Team | ~$599 [ESTIMATE] | $0.012–$0.04 |
| 50,000+ | Enterprise | Negotiated | TBD |

Supabase cost is not a meaningful gross margin risk at any pre-Series A scale.

### 10.5 Enterprise Revenue Mix Sensitivity

**Scenario:** Enterprise tier grows faster than consumer, shifting FORM's revenue mix.

| Enterprise % of MRR | Blended gross margin | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 5% enterprise, 95% consumer Pro | ~82% | Near-pure consumer economics; Western $19 ARPU baseline |
| 20% enterprise, 80% consumer Pro | ~83.5% | Modest mix improvement |
| 50% enterprise, 50% consumer Pro | ~86% | Direct billing on half of revenue eliminates store fee |
| 80% enterprise, 20% consumer Pro | ~88% | Significant uplift; CS cost assumed at 3% of enterprise ACV |

Each percentage point of revenue shifting from consumer to enterprise improves blended gross margin by ~0.1–0.15 pp. Mix improvement is a secondary margin lever — meaningful at scale (>$5M ARR) but not the primary driver. The primary driver remains consumer Pro pricing and App Store fee management.

**The strategic case for enterprise is not margin** — it is contract predictability, expansion potential, and NRR. A 100-seat enterprise deal paying annually upfront is qualitatively different from 100 individual Pro subscribers at monthly billing with 3–5% monthly churn.

## 11. Open Questions / Gaps

| # | Question | Impact if wrong | How to resolve |
|---|---|---|---|
| OQ-01 | What is actual token usage per session in beta? | High — drives the largest COGS line | Instrument `tokens_used` on every Anthropic API call; log to PostHog as a property on `chat_message_sent` event |
| OQ-02 | What is actual voice adoption rate? | Medium — second-largest COGS line | PostHog `feature_viewed` + `insight_generated` with `voice_enabled: true/false` property |
| OQ-03 | Does Anthropic offer volume pricing below $50k/month spend? | Medium — affects 10k–30k user scale | Direct conversation with Anthropic sales at $10k+/month spend |
| OQ-04 | Is the Small Business Program automatic or does it require active enrollment on App Store Connect? | High at launch — $2.25/user/month difference | Confirm with Apple developer documentation before launch |
| OQ-05 | What is the actual ElevenLabs per-character rate at Creator vs. Business plan tiers? | Medium | Review ElevenLabs pricing page; confirm with account representative |
| OQ-06 | At what MAU does PostHog cost become material (>$200/month)? | Low — well-modeled | Monitor PostHog usage dashboard monthly |
| OQ-07 | Does high voice adoption (>60%) measurably improve D90 retention? | High strategic importance | Segment D90 cohort by voice_enabled flag; measure after first 3-month cohort |
| OQ-08 | What is the true implementation cost per enterprise deal (eng hours + CS hours)? | High for enterprise margin model | Time-track first 3 enterprise deals |
| OQ-09 | How does Supabase bandwidth cost behave with wearable data sync (HealthKit/Health Connect)? | Medium — wearable data is high-frequency | Benchmark bandwidth during beta with wearables enabled |
| OQ-10 | Is there a Cloudflare Workers cost cliff from CV-adjacent edge processing? | Low — CV is on-device | Confirm no server-side CV inference at launch |
| OQ-11 | What is the minimum seat threshold at which a Starter plan deal generates acceptable Year 1 gross margin? | Medium — sets enterprise minimum deal floor | Track GM per closed deal for first 5 Starter contracts; §16.2 model suggests 50-seat floor may need to rise to 75+ if dedicated CSM cost exceeds $200/month allocation |

## 12. Free Tier Subsidy Model & Freemium Funnel Economics

Section §3.4 flags the core risk: "a free user who never converts to Pro is $0.13/month of pure cost." This section models what that subsidy costs at scale, what conversion rate makes it economically neutral, and how to benchmark freemium as an acquisition channel against paid marketing.

### 12.1 Free tier total subsidy at scale

Infrastructure cost per free user per month: **$0.13** (from §3.3).

| Free MAU | Monthly subsidy | Annual subsidy | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 500 | $65 | $780 | Closed beta phase — negligible |
| 2,000 | $260 | $3,120 | Early-access launch |
| 10,000 | $1,300 | $15,600 | Growth phase; meaningful but not alarming |
| 50,000 | $6,500 | $78,000 | Scale; now a budget line requiring active monitoring |
| 100,000 | $13,000 | $156,000 | Pre-Series A max free pool without explicit subsidy budget |

**Observation:** At any pre-Series A scale (≤100k free MAU), the raw infrastructure subsidy stays well below $200k/year and is covered by a modest number of Pro conversions. The free tier is not an infrastructure cost problem — it is a conversion discipline problem.

### 12.2 Minimum conversion rate for free tier self-financing

For the free tier to be cost-neutral from infrastructure COGS alone, converted users must generate enough gross profit to offset the ongoing subsidy of unconverted users.

**Variables:**
- `N` = free user pool size
- `C` = monthly conversion rate (free → Pro, cumulative by month M)
- Converted user generates `$15.65` gross profit/month (Pro at SBP, Western $19 ARPU, from §4)
- Remaining free user costs `$0.13`/month

**Break-even condition:**

```
N × C × $15.65  =  N × (1 − C) × $0.13

C / (1 − C)     =  0.13 / 15.65  =  0.00831

C               =  0.00831 / 1.00831  ≈  0.82%
```

**A lifetime conversion rate of ≥ 0.82% is sufficient to cover the pure infrastructure cost of the free tier** — regardless of free pool size. Typical well-designed freemium products convert 2–5% of free users to paid over the first 90 days. FORM's break-even threshold is intentionally conservative and should be achievable from the first beta cohort.

### 12.3 Conversion rate targets by phase

| Phase | Free MAU target | Required conversions/month to cover subsidy | Implied conversion rate floor |
|---|---|---|---|
| Beta (closed) | 500 | 1 Pro user | 0.2% |
| Early launch | 2,000 | 3 Pro users | 0.15% |
| Growth | 10,000 | 11 Pro users | 0.11% |
| Scale | 50,000 | 53 Pro users | 0.11% |

The required absolute conversion count is low at every phase. The strategic target is 2–5% cumulative conversion by D90 — well above the subsidy break-even floor — because the business goal is revenue, not merely cost neutrality.

### 12.4 Freemium CAC vs. paid acquisition

Freemium is an acquisition channel. The "cost" of acquiring a Pro subscriber via the free tier is the infrastructure subsidy paid during the pre-conversion period plus any organic/paid traffic cost to reach the free user.

**Infrastructure-only freemium CAC:**

```
Freemium CAC (infra) = months_to_convert × $0.13/month

If median conversion happens at month 2:  2 × $0.13 = $0.26
If median conversion happens at month 6:  6 × $0.13 = $0.78
```

Even at a 6-month pre-conversion window, the infrastructure portion of freemium CAC is under $1 per converted user — negligibly small.

**All-in freemium CAC** includes the cost of driving organic installs (App Store optimization, content marketing, referral mechanics) amortized over conversions:

| Traffic source | Cost/install [ESTIMATE] | Cost/Pro conversion (at 3% rate) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Pure organic (ASO, referral) | ~$0 | ~$0.78 (6mo subsidy only) | Best case; viral coefficient dependent |
| Content marketing (amortized) | $1–3 | $33–100 | Blog, social, educational content; high variance |
| Influencer / partnership (fitness) | $3–8 | $100–267 | Higher intent but expensive at scale |
| Paid UA (Meta/TikTok/Google) | $5–15 | $167–500 | Most expensive; often poorest LTV mix |

**Benchmark:** Consumer fitness apps typically report blended CAC of $30–80 via paid channels. If FORM can sustain meaningful organic install volume, freemium CAC stays well below this range — making the free tier a structurally superior acquisition channel compared to paid UA, provided conversion discipline is maintained.

### 12.5 Free tier cost controls

The $0.13/month figure is derived from the §2.1 usage assumptions for free users (6.5 sessions/month, 10% voice adoption). Both are controllable by design:

| Control | Current design | Cost impact if removed |
|---|---|---|
| Voice quota cap (free tier) | ElevenLabs character cap per month | Without cap: voice adoption rises; ElevenLabs cost ≈ $0.016 → potentially $0.08+/user |
| Session frequency (natural, not capped) | No hard session cap; organic 1.5×/week usage assumed | If free users use at Pro rate (3.5×/week): COGS ≈ $0.30/user — still manageable |
| Context window per session | Same as Pro (no reduction) | Context truncation on free would reduce Anthropic cost ~15%; deferred feature |
| Workout history depth | 30-day rolling window on free (hypothetical) | Reduces Supabase storage; minor COGS impact (~$0.005/user/month) |

**Design principle:** Free tier cost controls should be scoped features, not degraded experiences. The right levers are voice quota (highest cost impact) and session depth (contextual). Do not degrade coaching quality on free tier — that reduces conversion, which is the primary economic risk.

### 12.6 Free pool size governance

The free pool requires an explicit budget line once it reaches $1,300+/month (10k+ free MAU). Governance trigger:

| Monthly subsidy threshold | Action required |
|---|---|
| < $500/month (≤ 3,800 free MAU) | No action; implicit in infra budget |
| $500–2,000/month | Monitor conversion rate weekly in PostHog |
| $2,000–5,000/month | Explicit free-tier budget line in FINANCIALS.md; conversion rate OKR target |
| > $5,000/month (≥ 38,500 free MAU) | Board visibility; conversion funnel review; consider free-tier session throttle if D90 conversion < 1.5% |

**Note on free tier as a strategic asset:** Aggressive throttling of the free tier to reduce subsidy cost is a false economy. The free pool is the top of the funnel — cutting it to save $0.13/user/month sacrifices the acquisition engine. The right response to poor conversion is better activation (onboarding, first-value moment), not pool reduction.

## 13. Infrastructure Cost Breakdown by Service

This section replaces the high-level COGS summary in §3.3 with a service-by-service breakdown that shows absolute monthly spend, per-user cost at each scale tier, the upgrade inflection points, and the optimization levers available at each stage. Purpose: give investors and the future CFO a precise view of where spend accumulates and what can be actively managed.

**Assumptions for this section:**

- MAU mix modeled at 60% Free / 40% Pro (consumer). Enterprise is modeled separately in §8.
- Per-user behavioral rates from §2.1 apply throughout.
- Per-user COGS from §3.3 apply: Free $0.13/user/month; Pro $0.50/user/month.
- All figures [ESTIMATE] until reconciled against invoices.

### 13.1 Service-by-service cost table

| Service | Type | Current plan | 1k MAU total | 10k MAU total | 50k MAU total | 100k MAU total |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Anthropic Claude** | Variable | Pay-as-you-go (list price) | ~$134/mo | ~$1,344/mo | ~$6,720/mo | ~$13,440/mo |
| **ElevenLabs TTS** | Variable | Creator/Business API | ~$97/mo | ~$968/mo | ~$4,840/mo | ~$9,680/mo |
| **Supabase** | Fixed (step) | Pro ($25/mo) | $25/mo | $25/mo | $599/mo [Team] | $599/mo [Team] |
| **Cloudflare Workers** | Variable + fixed | Paid ($5/mo base) | ~$14/mo | ~$140/mo | ~$700/mo | ~$1,400/mo |
| **Sentry** | Fixed | Team (~$26/mo) | $26/mo | $26/mo | $26/mo | $26/mo [upgrade pressure] |
| **PostHog** | Variable (above 1M events) | Free tier | $0 | ~$310/mo | ~$2,790/mo | ~$5,890/mo |
| **Redis** | Fixed (step) | Managed cloud (est.) | ~$15/mo | ~$25/mo | ~$50/mo | ~$150/mo |
| **Expo / EAS** | Fixed | Production plan | ~$99/mo | ~$99/mo | ~$99/mo | ~$99/mo |
| **Total infrastructure** | — | — | **~$436/mo** | **~$3,197/mo** | **~$17,124/mo** | **~$33,884/mo** |
| **Per total MAU** | — | — | **$0.44/user** | **$0.32/user** | **$0.34/user** | **$0.34/user** |

All figures are [ESTIMATE]. The per-MAU blended cost stabilizes around $0.32–0.34 at 10k+ MAU because fixed overhead amortizes rapidly while variable cost per user holds steady until volume discounts apply.

### 13.2 Fixed vs. variable classification

**Fixed overhead (scale-insensitive at current stage):**

- Supabase plan fee — pays for compute and baseline capacity; does not move with user activity within the plan tier
- Cloudflare Workers base fee ($5/month) — pays for the Paid tier activation; request volume cost is variable but negligibly small at pre-50k scale
- Sentry Team plan — covers event volume well beyond any pre-Series A scenario
- Redis managed instance — provisioned capacity; actual memory usage scales gently
- Expo/EAS — CI/CD pipeline and build quota; not user-count driven

**Variable (scale with active users and session frequency):**

- Anthropic API — strictly proportional to sessions × tokens per session × active users
- ElevenLabs TTS — proportional to sessions × character volume × voice adoption rate
- Cloudflare Workers requests — proportional to sessions × API requests per session
- PostHog — proportional to total events per month once past the 1M free tier ceiling

**Key insight:** Fixed overhead at 1k MAU is ~$165/month (Supabase + Sentry + Redis + EAS). Variable API costs are ~$245/month. By 10k MAU, fixed overhead is still ~$175/month while variable is ~$2,700/month. The business is fundamentally variable-cost at scale, which is correct — cost scales with delivered value, not with provisioned capacity.

### 13.3 Plan upgrade inflection points (cost cliffs)

These are the scale milestones at which a service requires a plan change — either because capacity limits are reached or because a better pricing tier becomes economically justified.

| Service | Current ceiling | Upgrade trigger | New plan | Cost step-up |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Supabase** | ~10k–15k MAU (8GB DB, 250GB bandwidth) | DB approaching 8GB or monthly bandwidth >250GB | Team (~$599/mo) | $574/mo step-up (from $25) |
| **Supabase** | ~50k–100k MAU (Team plan limits) | Read replica contention or storage overage | Enterprise ($500–2,000/mo negotiated) [ESTIMATE] | $0–$1,400/mo additional |
| **PostHog** | 5k MAU / 1M events/month | Total events cross 1M/month | Pay-as-you-go at $0.00031/event | ~$310/mo at 10k MAU; ~$2,790/mo at 50k MAU |
| **Sentry** | Team plan: ~50k errors/day | Consistent daily error volume approaching cap, or need for performance monitoring | Business/Enterprise | $80–$150/mo [ESTIMATE] |
| **Anthropic** | No plan ceiling; list pricing | Monthly API spend reaches $10k–50k+ | Volume commitment discount tier | Rate negotiation, not a hard cliff |
| **ElevenLabs** | Creator: 100k chars/month | Exceeds plan character quota | Business tier / Enterprise API | Variable; Business ~$99/mo [ESTIMATE] |
| **Redis** | Scaled instance capacity | P99 latency increases or memory OOM errors | Larger managed instance | ~$50–200/mo additional [ESTIMATE] |
| **Cloudflare** | Workers: 50M requests/day (Paid) | Exceeds Workers Paid daily limit | Workers Unbound or Enterprise | Not expected pre-Series A |

**The only true hard cliff is Supabase** — the jump from $25/month Pro to $599/month Team is a 24× step-up in the plan line item. However, on a per-user basis at 15k+ MAU, the Team plan costs ~$0.04/user/month — less than the Anthropic API cost rounding error. This cliff is visually dramatic but economically negligible.

**ElevenLabs plan quotas** are a more immediate operational concern. At 40% Pro voice adoption with 15.1 sessions/month and 1,200 chars/session, each Pro user generates ~7,248 characters of TTS monthly. The Creator plan ($22/month) covers 100,000 characters — exhausted by approximately 14 Pro voice users. This means ElevenLabs must operate on the per-character API billing model from launch, not on plan-based character quotas. Current assumption ($0.30/1,000 chars via Creator/Business tier API billing) is correct operationally but requires confirming enterprise API pricing with ElevenLabs directly. See OQ-05.

### 13.4 Cost cliff analysis — step-function increases

The following events represent non-linear jumps in the monthly infrastructure bill:

**Cliff 1: Supabase Pro → Team at ~12k–15k MAU**
Step-up: +$574/month. Revenue context: at 15k MAU with 40% Pro mix (6,000 Pro users at $19/month Western), MRR is approximately $114,000. The Supabase step-up represents 0.5% of MRR. Not a strategic concern — but it does appear as a line-item spike in any monthly cost review. Pre-announce internally when DB usage crosses 6GB.

**Cliff 2: PostHog free → paid at ~5k MAU**
Step-up: ~$310/month at 10k MAU; $2,790/month at 50k MAU. The 10k cliff is small. The 50k cliff is real (~2.4% of MRR at that scale assuming $116k MRR from Pro users alone). PostHog costs scale predictably — no sudden jump beyond the free tier exit. Acceptable; budget as a known line item at the 10k milestone.

**Cliff 3: Anthropic volume commitment threshold at ~30k–50k Pro MAU** [ESTIMATE]
This is not a cost increase — it is a cost decrease opportunity. When monthly Anthropic API spend approaches $10k–50k/month, volume commitment pricing becomes negotiable. Missing this window (continuing on list pricing past that threshold) is the inverse cliff: a failure to capture available savings. At 30k Pro MAU with current usage, estimated Anthropic spend is ~$6,000/month. Engagement target: initiate Anthropic sales conversation at $3k/month spend.

**Cliff 4: ElevenLabs at scale — enterprise API negotiation**
At 50k total MAU with 40% Pro mix (20k Pro users), estimated ElevenLabs API cost at list pricing is ~$4,840/month (from §13.1 table). This is the point at which audio caching becomes economically decisive. A 60% cache hit rate on common coaching cues reduces this to ~$1,936/month — a $2,900/month saving. Audio caching should be implemented before reaching 10k Pro MAU, not after.

**Summary: when to act**

| Milestone | Trigger action |
|---|---|
| 5k total MAU | Monitor PostHog event volume; budget $300/month for analytics starting M+1 |
| 12k total MAU | Provision Supabase Team plan; schedule DB migration before 7.5GB |
| 3k Pro MAU or $3k/mo Anthropic spend | Initiate Anthropic sales contact for committed spend pricing |
| 8k Pro MAU (voice-enabled) | Implement audio caching for common cues; audit ElevenLabs character volume |
| 30k total MAU | Begin Sentry Business evaluation; Supabase Enterprise scoping |

### 13.5 Optimization levers by service

**Anthropic Claude — highest priority**

1. **Prompt caching.** Claude supports caching of static context segments via the `cache_control` API parameter. Victor's base persona, safety rules, and exercise reference library (~800–1,200 tokens) is static per-user-session. Caching this segment reduces input token cost on cached content by up to 90% (cache hits are billed at $0.30/1M tokens vs. $3.00/1M). [ESTIMATE: saves $0.03–0.06/Pro user/month at current usage; at 10k Pro users = $300–600/month]

2. **Model tiering.** Route low-complexity tasks (intent classification, set logging confirmation, push notification copy) to Claude Haiku (significantly cheaper than Sonnet). Reserve Sonnet for genuine coaching turns and program adaptation. Target: 40–50% of API calls routable to Haiku. [ESTIMATE: 20–30% API cost reduction on the Haiku-routed portion]

3. **Context window management.** The current assumption is 2,000 input tokens/session (§2.1). Implementing a sliding history window (most recent 5 sessions rather than full history) caps token growth as users accumulate history. Without this, long-tenure user costs grow logarithmically.

4. **Committed spend / volume pricing.** Target $10k/month API spend as the conversation threshold with Anthropic sales. Typical discount 10–25% at this level. [ESTIMATE]

**ElevenLabs — second priority**

1. **Audio caching.** Victor's coaching vocabulary is finite and highly repetitive. Pre-generate and CDN-cache the top 200–300 cue phrases ("Good depth on that squat", "Elbows up and in", "Brace your core before the lift"). [ESTIMATE: 60–70% cache hit rate on character volume, reducing effective TTS cost by ~50%]

2. **Character quota management.** Enforce per-user monthly character budgets in the application layer. Free tier: hard cap. Pro tier: soft cap with graceful degradation to text-only coaching beyond threshold.

3. **Enterprise API pricing.** Negotiate directly with ElevenLabs at the point where monthly character volume exceeds 10M characters (~1,400 Pro users at current usage rates). Direct enterprise rates typically undercut Business tier list pricing at this volume.

**Supabase — low priority, well-managed**

1. **Read replicas for analytics.** Route all dashboard and analytics queries to a read replica (available on Team plan and above). Prevents analytical workloads from impacting production DB compute, which would trigger auto-scaling charges.

2. **Storage tiering.** Workout history data older than 12 months can be moved to Supabase Storage (object storage, significantly cheaper than DB rows) or cold-archived. Reduces DB size growth rate by ~40% for mature users. [ESTIMATE]

3. **Connection pooling (PgBouncer).** Already included in Supabase architecture. Ensure Cloudflare Workers connections route through PgBouncer to prevent connection exhaustion at scale.

**PostHog — deferred**

Costs are predictable and linear above 1M events. No optimization lever is economically significant at pre-50k MAU. At 100k MAU, consider: sampling non-critical events (e.g., `feature_viewed` for low-priority screens at 50% sample rate) to reduce event volume and cost. Preserve full fidelity on revenue-critical events (subscription state changes, session completions, conversion funnel events).

**Cloudflare Workers — minimal action required**

Request costs are negligible at any pre-Series A scale. Optimization only relevant if compute-intensive Workers (e.g., video frame processing) are introduced — currently not in scope (CV is on-device per §2.3).

**Redis — passive**

Sized appropriately for session store and rate limiting. No optimization levers at current scale. Scale instance up reactively on P99 latency signal.

## 14. Cohort LTV Model & CAC Payback Period

This section models the expected revenue and gross profit generated by a subscriber cohort over 24 months, derives the payback period at different CAC assumptions, and establishes the LTV:CAC framework FORM will use in investor reporting. All churn figures are [ESTIMATE] — pre-launch benchmarks from comparable fitness and consumer SaaS products. These will be replaced with cohort actuals from beta as data accumulates. The first replacement checkpoint is M3 post-beta launch.

### 14.1 Model assumptions and inputs

| Parameter | Pro monthly | Pro annual | Enterprise (seat) | Source |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Monthly subscription churn | 5.0% [ESTIMATE] | 1.5%/month [ESTIMATE] | 15%/year logo churn [ESTIMATE] | Fitness app benchmark; Noom/Calm public reports |
| Net ARPU (after App Store SBP 15%) | $16.15/month | $10.20/month equiv. | $12/seat/month (direct) | §9.2; annual plan at $144/year × 0.85 ÷ 12 |
| Infrastructure COGS | $0.50/month | $0.50/month | $0.34/seat/month | §3.3 |
| Gross margin target | 85% | 85% | 89% | §6.1 |
| CAC range modeled | $30–$120 | $30–$120 | $1,350–$10,750 | §8.5; consumer benchmark |

**Note on annual plan ARPU:** The $10.20/month net figure reflects an annual price of $144/year with 15% App Store SBP fee applied at the point of billing. Annual plan subscribers churn at approximately one-third the rate of monthly subscribers (1.5% vs. 5% monthly churn [ESTIMATE]) because the renewal decision is annual, not monthly. This lower churn more than compensates for the reduced per-month ARPU in LTV terms.

### 14.2 Pro monthly subscriber — cohort survival and cumulative revenue

Starting cohort: 100 subscribers acquired in month 0 at $16.15 net ARPU/month. Monthly churn: 5% [ESTIMATE].

**Survival formula:** `Remaining subscribers at month M = 100 × (1 − 0.05)^(M−1)`

| Month | Cohort survival rate | Monthly net revenue (per original subscriber) | Cumulative gross revenue | Cumulative GM-adjusted LTV (85%) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 100.0% | $16.15 | $16.15 | $13.73 |
| 3 | 90.2% | $14.58 | $46.07 | $39.16 |
| 6 | 77.4% | $12.50 | $85.57 | $72.73 |
| 12 | 56.9% | $9.19 | $148.46 | $126.19 |
| 18 | 41.8% | $6.75 | $194.70 | $165.49 |
| 24 | 30.7% | $4.96 | $228.69 | $194.38 |

**Reading the table:** By month 24, approximately 31 of the original 100 subscribers remain. The cohort has generated $228.69 in cumulative gross revenue per original subscriber, of which $194.38 is gross-margin-adjusted LTV (at 85% GM). The curve is front-loaded: the first 6 months capture 37% of 24-month LTV while retaining 77% of the cohort.

### 14.3 Pro annual subscriber — cohort survival and cumulative revenue

Annual plan: $144/year ($120/year with 20% discount, or $144 list). Net ARPU after SBP: $10.20/month equivalent. Monthly churn: 1.5% [ESTIMATE].

| Month | Cohort survival rate | Monthly net revenue equiv. | Cumulative gross revenue | Cumulative GM-adjusted LTV (85%) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 100.0% | $10.20 | $10.20 | $8.67 |
| 3 | 97.0% | $9.90 | $30.14 | $25.62 |
| 6 | 92.7% | $9.46 | $58.95 | $50.11 |
| 12 | 84.7% | $8.64 | $112.79 | $95.87 |
| 18 | 77.3% | $7.89 | $161.96 | $137.67 |
| 24 | 70.6% | $7.20 | $206.87 | $175.84 |

**Comparison with monthly plan:** Annual plan 24-month GM-adjusted LTV ($175.84) is lower than monthly ($194.38) in absolute terms, purely because monthly ARPU is higher ($16.15 vs. $10.20). However, the annual plan retains 70.6% of the cohort at month 24 versus 30.7% for monthly — annual subscribers are structurally more durable. For predictable cash flow and lower CAC payback pressure, annual plan mix is strategically preferable even with lower per-unit LTV.

**Annual plan deferred revenue note:** Subscription revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period. A subscriber paying $144 upfront creates $144 of cash inflow in month 0 and $12/month of recognized revenue over 12 months. The cash timing benefit is real and material for a capital-light pre-Series A company. However, under GAAP/IFRS, annual plan payments appear as deferred revenue on the balance sheet and are recognized at $12/month — investors and auditors will see both the cash and the recognition schedule. Disclose clearly in financial reports.

### 14.4 CAC payback period analysis — Pro monthly plan

CAC payback period = the number of months until cumulative gross-margin-adjusted revenue from a subscriber cohort equals the initial acquisition cost. Using 85% GM and 5% monthly churn [ESTIMATE].

Monthly GM contribution per surviving subscriber at month M:
`GM_M = $16.15 × (1 − 0.05)^(M−1) × 0.85`

Cumulative GM contribution builds month by month until it crosses the CAC threshold:

| CAC | Payback month | M12 GM-adj LTV | M24 GM-adj LTV | LTV:CAC at M12 | LTV:CAC at M24 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| $30 | Month 3 | $126.19 | $194.38 | **4.2×** | **6.5×** |
| $50 | Month 4 | $126.19 | $194.38 | **2.5×** | **3.9×** |
| $80 | Month 7 | $126.19 | $194.38 | **1.6×** | **2.4×** |
| $120 | Month 12 | $126.19 | $194.38 | **1.1×** | **1.6×** |

**Interpretation:** CAC below $50 delivers payback inside Q1 of the customer relationship — structurally excellent. CAC at $80 pays back in 7 months — acceptable for a consumer subscription with a 24-month expected life. CAC above $120 pushes payback to month 12 and yields LTV:CAC of 1.6× at M24 — this is below the conventional 3× minimum benchmark and would require either churn improvement or ARPU expansion (upgrades, annual conversion) to be defensible.

### 14.5 LTV:CAC ratio targets and rationale

**Consumer Pro targets:**

| Scenario | LTV:CAC target | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Organic / content-driven | ≥ 5× at M24 | CAC $30–40 expected; should deliver 4.9–6.5× |
| Paid social (Meta/TikTok) | ≥ 3× at M24 | CAC $50–80 expected; minimum defensible threshold |
| Maximum paid UA ceiling | ≥ 2× at M24 | CAC ~$100; only acceptable with path to annual conversion |

The conventional SaaS benchmark is 3:1 LTV:CAC with payback under 12 months. Consumer subscription benchmarks are slightly different — Calm, Headspace, and comparable wellness apps report blended LTV:CAC of 2–4× depending on channel mix. FORM targets the upper end of this range (3–5×) by prioritizing organic and content-led growth over paid UA.

**Why 3× is a floor, not a target:** At 3× LTV:CAC, after accounting for overhead allocation, the actual return on acquisition spend is thin. At 5×+, acquisition investment compounds meaningfully and provides headroom for higher CAC in channels that deliver better retention cohorts (e.g., users who discover FORM via sports science content convert at lower rates but churn at half the rate of paid UA users — higher CAC, much higher LTV).

**Do not optimize CAC in isolation.** A $30 CAC from influencer campaigns may deliver worse 12-month LTV than an $80 CAC from organic content (higher intent, higher activation, lower churn). Track LTV:CAC by acquisition channel, not blended. This is a PostHog + Supabase cohort join query, not a back-of-envelope calculation.

### 14.6 Enterprise LTV model

Enterprise LTV is driven by initial ACV, expansion (seat growth and new feature adoption), and logo retention. The NRR model assumes 120% NRR [ESTIMATE] — meaning each surviving customer cohort grows 20% per year in ARR terms. This requires ~41% seat/price expansion on retained logos to offset 15% annual logo churn.

**Minimum contract baseline:** 40 seats × $12/seat/month × 12 = **$5,760 ACV** (from §8.3).

**Enterprise cohort LTV at 120% NRR, 15% annual logo churn [ESTIMATE], 89% gross margin:**

| Year | ACV (per average deal) | GM-adjusted annual revenue | Cumulative GM-adj LTV |
|---|---|---|---|
| Year 1 | $5,760 | $5,126 | $5,126 |
| Year 2 | $6,912 [120% NRR applied] | $6,152 | $11,278 |
| Year 3 | $8,294 | $7,382 | $18,660 |

**3-year GM-adjusted LTV on minimum deal: ~$18,660.** Against a CAC of ~$1,350 (small deal, §8.5): **LTV:CAC = 13.8×**.

At larger deal sizes (with proportionally higher but sub-linear CAC from §8.5):

| Deal size | Starting ACV | 3yr GM-adj LTV | CAC midpoint | LTV:CAC |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Minimum (40 seats) | $5,760 | $18,660 | $1,350 | **13.8×** |
| Mid (100 seats) | $36,000 | $116,626 | $4,200 | **27.8×** |
| Large (500 seats) | $210,000 | $680,316 | $10,750 | **63.3×** |

Enterprise LTV:CAC ratios are structurally superior to consumer at every deal size. The minimum 40-seat deal returns ~14× over 3 years. The economic argument for investing in enterprise GTM is not margin (which is already excellent at both tiers) but predictability: annual contracts, invoiced directly, with expanding seat counts, generate ARR that is fundamentally more stable than consumer monthly churn.

**Expansion revenue mechanics at 120% NRR:** An enterprise account that starts at 40 seats and expands to the company-wide headcount of 200 seats over 24 months goes from $5,760 ACV to $28,800 ACV — a 5× ACV expansion on a single logo. This is the land-and-expand motion. The CAC is fixed at ~$1,350 (acquisition cost does not repeat on expansion); the incremental 160 seats are zero-CAC revenue. This is why NRR >100% is such a powerful metric for enterprise SaaS valuation multiples.

### 14.7 Cohort survival curve — qualitative requirements

What does FORM's retention curve need to look like to hit the targets above?

**The shape that matters:** A healthy retention curve for a fitness app is not a smooth exponential decay. It is a steep initial drop (first 30 days: users who installed out of curiosity but never activated) followed by a flattening into a durable core cohort. The users who complete 3+ coached sessions in the first 14 days (the activation milestone from METRICS.md) are the ones who define the flat tail. The initial drop is expected and acceptable; the floor of the curve is what determines LTV.

**Target curve shape:**
- D1 retention: >60% [ESTIMATE] — users open the app the day after install
- D7 retention: >40% [ESTIMATE] — first week engagement signal
- D30 retention: >25% [ESTIMATE] — the "will this person stick?" threshold
- M3 retention (monthly active): >20% [ESTIMATE] — 5% monthly churn means 86% survive month-to-month, so M3 = ~86^2 = ~74% for already-retained users; but accounting for trial-to-paid churn cliff, effective M3 paying retention should be ~65–70%
- M12 retention (monthly active): >10% [ESTIMATE] — aligns with 56.9% cohort survival at month 12 in the LTV table above

**The churn cliff to avoid:** Consumer subscriptions show a consistent pattern of elevated churn at the first billing renewal (day 7–14 for free trials, day 30 for first paid month). FORM's onboarding and early activation design must specifically address this cliff — users who have not experienced a "coaching moment that felt personalized" by day 10 are extremely likely to cancel at first renewal. The activation funnel target (3 coached sessions in 14 days) is designed to get users past this cliff.

**What 5% monthly churn means in practice:** A cohort of 1,000 subscribers acquired in January will have approximately 540 remaining at December (month 12) — a 46% loss over the year. This is the benchmark being modeled. If actual beta churn comes in below 5%, every LTV figure above improves materially. If churn comes in at 8–10% (worse than benchmark), the CAC payback math at $80+ CAC breaks down and acquisition spend must be curtailed until churn is diagnosed and addressed.

**Leading indicators to watch (from PostHog):**

- W-ACSU (Weekly Active Coached Sessions per User) — the NSM from METRICS.md. Users with W-ACSU ≥ 2.5 in their first month churn at roughly half the rate of users with W-ACSU < 1.0. [ESTIMATE — to be validated in beta]
- Chat message sent frequency — users who use the AI coaching chat ≥ 3 times per week show substantially lower churn in comparable AI wellness products
- Session streak length — unbroken session streaks are a strong leading indicator; a 7-day streak in week 2 is the strongest early predictor of 90-day retention in fitness apps

### 14.8 Data pipeline for cohort LTV tracking

LTV is not a formula you run once — it is a live cohort measurement that requires a functioning data pipeline. FORM's approach:

**Source tables:** `fact_events` (session completions, billing events), `dim_users` (acquisition channel, install date, tier), subscription state from Supabase (server-side, trusted).

**Cohort definition:** Cohort = week of first subscription payment (not install). A user who installs in week 1 and subscribes in week 3 enters the cohort in week 3. This is the correct definition for LTV purposes — LTV clock starts at first revenue, not first install.

**Retention metric computed daily** via ETL (§pipeline in ANALYTICS_SETUP.md): for each cohort-month, count users who made at least one session in that calendar month divided by original cohort size. Output: retention matrix stored in ClickHouse `fact_cohort_retention` table.

**CAC by channel** sourced from paid attribution (UTM parameters → PostHog → Supabase), organic attribution (ASO, referral codes), and estimated content marketing cost amortized over organic installs per month.

**LTV:CAC report** computed as a saved Metabase question: join `fact_cohort_retention` × `dim_users.acquisition_channel` × marketing spend table. Updated weekly. Owner: data-engineer.

**Backfill note:** Until 90 days of post-launch data exist, LTV figures in investor reports will be labeled "projected based on [ESTIMATE] benchmark churn." The first cohort with real 90-day data is the point at which [ESTIMATE] tags are removed from §14.2 and §14.3. Target: M6 post-launch.

## 15. Enterprise Infrastructure COGS Deep-Dive

Unlike consumer tiers, enterprise deployments carry additional infrastructure features — SSO, SCIM, admin dashboard, audit log delivery, and optional white-label. This section quantifies the marginal infrastructure cost of each enterprise-specific capability and explains why none of them materially change the baseline $0.34/seat/month COGS from §3.3.

**Core finding: enterprise features are operationally lightweight.** SSO/SCIM, audit logs, admin dashboards, and SIEM webhooks are all low-compute, low-bandwidth operations that together add less than $0.002/seat/month to infrastructure COGS. The enterprise tier's high gross margin (~97% on infrastructure, ~89% blended with CS) is not a modeling artifact — it reflects the reality that identity, auditing, and analytics workloads are inexpensive at the compute level.

### 15.1 SSO/SAML token validation overhead

Each enterprise login generates additional Cloudflare Workers calls compared to a standard JWT auth flow:

| Step | Workers requests | Description |
|---|---|---|
| SAML assertion receipt | 1 | IdP POST to FORM ACS endpoint (`/auth/saml/acs`) |
| Assertion validation + RLS context set | 1 | HMAC verification, tenant scoping |
| Session JWT issuance | 1 | Signed token issued and cached in Redis |
| **Total per SSO login** | **3** | vs. 2 requests for standard email/password |

Marginal SSO overhead per seat per month:

```
Sessions/month (enterprise): 12.9
Additional Workers requests vs. standard JWT: 1 per login
Cost: 12.9 × $0.50 / 1,000,000 = $0.0000065/seat/month
At 500 seats: $0.003/month total
```

**OIDC vs. SAML:** OIDC token validation (OAuth 2.0 code exchange) follows the same 3-step pattern. No cost differential between SAML and OIDC implementation at any realistic scale.

**Assessment: negligible.** The entire Cloudflare Workers overhead for enterprise SSO across 500 seats for a full year is approximately $0.04. Not a material cost driver at any deal size.

### 15.2 SCIM provisioning API costs

SCIM v2 events (create, update, deactivate) occur when the IdP syncs directory changes to FORM. Per `docs/SSO_SCIM_IMPLEMENTATION.md §4`, FORM exposes `/scim/v2/Users` and `/scim/v2/Groups`. Assumed frequency: 5% monthly workforce turnover = approximately 0.2 SCIM events/seat/month on average.

| SCIM event type | Workers requests | DB writes | Typical frequency |
|---|---|---|---|
| User create (new hire) | 2 | 1 (insert + RLS policy attach) | Hire rate |
| User update (role/group change) | 2 | 1 (update) | Occasional |
| User deprovision (termination) | 2 | 1 (soft-delete + seat release) | ~5% annually |
| Group sync (SCIM Groups → FORM roles) | 2 | 1 (role mapping update) | On group change |
| **Per seat average** | **~0.4 req/month** | **~0.2 writes/month** | At 5% monthly turnover |

Monthly cost per seat:

```
Workers: 0.4 × $0.50/1M = $0.0000002/seat/month
DB writes: within Supabase plan capacity — no marginal charge
```

**SCIM bearer token** is per-tenant, stored hashed, rotated on customer request or annually (DEC-030 mandated rotation cadence). Token validation adds zero marginal compute.

**Assessment: negligible.** SCIM is an availability and latency engineering concern, not a cost concern.

### 15.3 Admin dashboard query load

Admin dashboard users (HR leads, People ops, IT admins) run analytics queries against the enterprise admin API. Assumed: 2 admin users per 100 seats, checking dashboard 5×/week. All queries routed to Supabase read replica (available on Team plan and above).

| Dashboard view | Read-replica DB queries | Workers requests | Cadence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Engagement overview (weekly trend chart) | 4 | 1 | Daily |
| Seat utilisation table | 2 | 1 | 2×/week |
| Audit log viewer (last 50 events) | 3 | 1 | Weekly |
| User provisioning list | 2 | 1 | As-needed |

Monthly admin query load per 100 seats:

```
Admin users: 2
Sessions/week per admin: 5
Weeks/month: 4.3
Avg DB queries per session: 4

Total DB queries: 2 × 5 × 4.3 × 4 = 172 queries/month per 100 seats
= 1.72 queries/seat/month

Workers requests: 2 × 5 × 4.3 × 1 = 43 requests/100 seats/month
= 43 × $0.50/1M = $0.0000215/month per 100 seats
= $0.000000215/seat/month
```

**Supabase cost:** Read-replica queries are included in Team plan ($599/month base). No per-query billing. Marginal cost of admin dashboard load: $0 on the existing Supabase plan.

**Assessment: negligible.** Admin dashboard is among the highest-value enterprise features and costs effectively nothing to serve. The investment is in the product surface (see `admin-dashboard.html`), not in its runtime cost.

### 15.4 Audit log storage and long-term retention

Audit log events are generated for every material action per `docs/AUDIT_LOG_SCHEMA.md` and the HMAC-chain specification in DEC-030. Events are append-only and immutable once written.

| Audit event type | Bytes per record | Events/seat/month |
|---|---|---|
| Session completion | ~350 | 12.9 |
| SCIM provisioning event | ~480 | 0.2 |
| Admin dashboard access | ~280 | 1.72 |
| Billing / seat change | ~420 | 0.08 (annual contract) |
| Break-glass access | ~620 | < 0.01 (rare) |
| **Weighted average** | **~370 bytes** | **~14.9 events/seat/month** |

Monthly storage growth per seat:

```
14.9 events × 370 bytes = 5,513 bytes ≈ 5.4 KB/seat/month
```

**Hot tier (0–90 days in PostgreSQL `audit_log` table):**

```
90-day hot window: 5.4 KB × 3 months = 16.2 KB/seat
At 500 seats: 7.9 MB total — negligible within Supabase Team plan (1 TB)
```

**Cold tier (90 days–7 years in Supabase Storage):**

HMAC-chained `.ndjson` files, one per tenant per calendar day, synced to Supabase Storage (and optionally customer S3):

```
7-year retention: 5.4 KB × 84 months = 453.6 KB/seat total
At Supabase Storage rate $0.021/GB:
0.44 MB / 1,024 MB × $0.021 = $0.0000090/seat for full 7-year archive
Per month amortized: $0.0000090 / 84 months = $0.00000011/seat/month
```

**SIEM webhook delivery (Growth+ tier only):**

```
Events streamed to SIEM: ~14.9/seat/month
1 Workers outbound request per event
Cost: 14.9 × $0.50/1M = $0.0000075/seat/month
At 500 seats with SIEM enabled: $0.0037/month
```

**Assessment: negligible.** Seven-year tamper-evident audit log with SIEM streaming adds under $0.001/seat/month total. The value delivered (SOC 2 CC6.1 evidence, customer SIEM integration, regulatory retention compliance) is not a function of its infrastructure cost.

### 15.5 White-label cost model (Growth+, ≥ $50k ARR)

White-label delivers a custom domain (e.g., `fit.acme.com`) routing to FORM's product. Infrastructure components:

| Component | Provider | Per-tenant monthly cost | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Custom domain routing | Cloudflare Workers Routes | $0 | Custom domains included in Workers Paid plan; no per-domain charge |
| SSL/TLS certificate | Cloudflare | $0 | Cloudflare-managed; auto-renewed; no per-certificate cost |
| DNS CNAME validation | Cloudflare | $0 | Tenant adds one CNAME record; Cloudflare handles resolution |
| Tenant logo + favicon storage | Supabase Storage | ~$0.001 | ~50 KB assets; $0.021/GB = $0.001/month |
| Custom color palette | CSS variable override in `tenant_config` | $0 | Theme tokens in DB row; no compute overhead |
| Accessibility floor enforcement | One-time engineering check | $0 recurring | WCAG AA contrast ratio verified at setup; not a recurring cost |

**Monthly white-label infrastructure cost: ~$0.001/tenant/month.**

The one-time setup cost is modeled in §8.2 ($800–1,500 per deal, including custom domain DNS, branding asset upload, and accessibility validation). The recurring infrastructure cost of white-label is negligible.

**Why white-label is gated at ≥ $50k ARR, not priced as a feature add-on:** The gate exists to ensure the one-time engineering setup cost is amortized against sufficient contract value, and to prevent brand dilution from small or low-commitment accounts. It is a strategic threshold, not a cost-driven pricing mechanism. The cost of delivering white-label is near-zero.

### 15.6 Multi-tenant RLS overhead

Row-Level Security enforces tenant isolation at the PostgreSQL layer (see `docs/DATA_MODEL.md §3`). Every query against a RLS-protected table has the relevant policy evaluated server-side before rows are returned.

**Performance overhead:** RLS adds 2–8% additional query latency on typical Supabase-hosted workloads — well within FORM's P99 < 200ms API response target. CPU overhead is negligible.

**Billing impact:** RLS is a PostgreSQL native feature. Supabase does not charge per-policy or per-evaluation. The Supabase plan cost is unchanged by RLS enablement.

**Scale behavior:** RLS overhead is constant regardless of tenant count. The policy `tenant_id = current_setting('app.tenant_id')::uuid` is evaluated in O(1) per row scan — it does not grow with the number of tenants on the platform.

**Cross-tenant query prevention:** RLS policies reject cross-tenant access at the DB layer before rows are returned to the application. This eliminates the need for an application-layer tenant lookup on every query, which would be both slower and less secure.

**Assessment: zero cost impact.** RLS is a security architecture decision. Its value is the isolation guarantee, not a cost tradeoff.

### 15.7 Enterprise infrastructure COGS summary

| Enterprise feature | Marginal cost/seat/month | Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| SSO/SAML token validation overhead | $0.0000065 | Negligible |
| SCIM provisioning (at 5% monthly turnover) | $0.0000002 | Negligible |
| Admin dashboard queries (2 admins/100 seats) | $0.0000002 | Negligible |
| Audit log hot-tier DB storage | $0.0000001 | Negligible |
| Audit log cold-tier (7yr Supabase Storage) | $0.0000001 | Negligible |
| SIEM webhook delivery (Growth+ only) | $0.0000075 | Negligible |
| White-label infrastructure (per tenant, amortized/seat) | $0.000002 | Negligible |
| Multi-tenant RLS | $0 | No billing impact |
| **Total enterprise feature overhead** | **< $0.00001/seat/month** | **Effectively zero** |
| **Baseline enterprise COGS (§3.3)** | **$0.34/seat/month** | From coaching sessions + voice |
| **True enterprise all-in COGS** | **~$0.34/seat/month** | No material change |

**The enterprise premium features — SSO, SCIM, admin dashboard, audit log, white-label, RLS — add less than 0.003% to per-seat infrastructure COGS.** This is the structural explanation for why enterprise infrastructure gross margin reaches 97%+. The real cost of enterprise is not compute — it is engineering time (one-time, modeled in §8.2) and customer success labor (ongoing, modeled in §8.4). Enterprise infrastructure itself is delivered at near-zero marginal cost.

## 16. Enterprise Tier Break-Even by Plan

This section extends §8 by computing the break-even deal economics for each enterprise plan tier (Starter, Growth, Enterprise), incorporating all cost components: infrastructure COGS, one-time implementation cost amortized over Year 1, and dedicated CS labor allocation. It identifies the minimum seat threshold below which Year 1 economics are marginal, and quantifies the economic incentive for multi-year contracts.

**Rate card used:** Starter $12/seat/month (50–200 seats), Growth $9/seat/month (200–1,000 seats), Enterprise $6–8/seat/month (1,000+ seats), per `enterprise.html` and `docs/ENTERPRISE.md`. All figures [ESTIMATE] until first 5 signed deals per tier are time-tracked.

**Assumptions:**
- Infrastructure COGS: $0.34/seat/month (§3.3 + §15.7 — enterprise features add nothing material)
- Implementation cost amortized over 12 months (Year 1 only; zero in Year 2+)
- Implementation cost midpoints from §8.2 ($1,150 for small deals, $1,500 for mid, $2,000 for large)
- CS allocation: $200/month for Starter accounts; $300/month for Growth; $400–500/month for Enterprise
- All figures are annual

### 16.1 Plan-level break-even table

| Plan | Seats | Monthly ACV | Annual ACV | Infra COGS (yr) | Impl. cost | CS cost (yr) | Total cost (yr) | Gross profit (yr) | GM% Y1 |

All figures [ESTIMATE]. Implementation cost is a one-time charge amortized against Year 1 ACV. CS cost is the dedicated CSM labor allocation (§8.2).

### 16.2 Minimum viable Starter deal analysis

The 50-seat Starter deal at $12/seat/month generates $7,200 ACV but only 47.9% gross margin in Year 1. The drag is the fixed implementation ($1,150) and CS labor ($2,400/year) amortized over a small seat base.

**Year 2 dynamics:** When implementation cost drops to zero, the same 50-seat deal yields:

```
Y2 GM = ($7,200 − $204 infra − $0 impl − $2,400 CS) / $7,200
       = $4,596 / $7,200 = 63.8%
```

63.8% Year 2 margin is below the enterprise blended target (89%, §8.4) but above the consumer Pro margin floor at the lower end of the App Store tax range (~67%). The deal is economically viable across the full contract term; Year 1 is the investment round.

**The minimum floor problem:** §8.3 cites a 20-seat minimum as historically the floor, but this section reveals that 20 seats at $12/seat/month ($2,880 ACV) would generate negative gross profit in Year 1:

```
20-seat Y1 cost: $82 infra + $1,150 impl + $2,400 CS = $3,632
20-seat Y1 ACV: $2,880
Y1 gross profit: −$752 (−26.1%)
```

**20-seat deals destroy margin in Year 1 at Starter pricing.** The minimum economic floor, given current CS cost allocation, is approximately **40–50 seats at $12/seat/month** for Year 1 neutrality. This is OQ-11.

**Recommendation:** The 40-seat minimum stated in §8.3 is at the edge of viability. If dedicated CSM cost per small account exceeds the $200/month model allocation (e.g., if onboarding requires more than 1 hr/week sustained for 6 months), the minimum should rise to 75 seats. Track actual CS hours on first 5 Starter deals before committing to sub-50-seat pilots.

### 16.3 Year 1 vs. Year 2+ margin improvement by plan

Implementation cost is a one-time event. From Year 2, the same deal generates materially higher net margin:

| Plan | Seats | Y1 GM% | Y2 GM% | Improvement | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Starter · 50 seats | 50 | 47.9% | 63.8% | +15.9 pp | Large Y1 drag from fixed impl/CS on small base |
| Starter · 200 seats | 200 | 84.8% | 88.0% | +3.2 pp | Fixed costs amortized; near-steady-state |
| Growth · 200 seats ($9/seat) | 200 | 72.6% | 79.6% | +7.0 pp | Y1 impl drag on lower ACV-per-seat |
| Growth · 1,000 seats | 1,000 | 90.4% | 91.8% | +1.4 pp | Fixed costs negligible vs. ACV |
| Enterprise · 1,000 seats ($6/seat) | 1,000 | 85.6% | 87.7% | +2.1 pp | CS cost dominant at lower per-seat rate |

**The Year 1 investment period** is longest and most visible at small seat counts. For Starter 50-seat accounts, Year 1 margin (47.9%) is substantially below steady-state (63.8%). This means the first cohort of small enterprise accounts will show compressed margins in investor financials until Year 2 data is available. Pre-empt this in investor communication: label Year 1 enterprise margin as "including implementation amortization" and show the Year 2 steady-state figure alongside it.

**Expansion within the contract term** changes these numbers materially. A 50-seat Starter that expands to 100 seats at M6 (mid-contract) sees effective Year 1 economics shift toward the 200-seat row — expansion revenue carries zero additional implementation cost.

### 16.4 Multi-year contract economics

Multi-year contracts (2-year at 15% discount, 3-year at 25% discount per `enterprise.html`) are offered on Growth and Enterprise tiers. Despite the lower per-year ACV, multi-year deals are economically superior for three compounding reasons:

**1. Implementation cost is a smaller percentage of lifetime ACV:**

```
200-seat Growth, $9/seat, annual:
  Y1 total cost: $816 + $1,500 + $3,600 = $5,916 on $21,600 ACV
  Implementation as % of Y1 ACV: 6.9%

Same deal, 3-year at 25% discount ($9 × 0.75 = $6.75/seat/month):
  3-year ACV: $6.75 × 200 × 36 = $48,600
  Implementation as % of 3-year ACV: 3.1%
```

The implementation cost halves as a percentage of lifetime revenue. The discount is given back to the customer; the economics improve for FORM through amortization.

**2. Logo churn risk is eliminated for the signed term:**

Enterprise logo churn is modeled at 15% annually (§8.7). In a single-year renewal model, a 10-deal cohort at $21,600 ACV loses ~1.5 logos per year. A 3-year signed contract locks all 10 logos for the full term regardless of churn signal — worth approximately $32,400 in protected ARR per renewal cycle on a 10-deal cohort.

**3. Cash flow timing:**

Annual prepay on a 3-year contract delivers 3× the upfront cash versus annual renewals. For a pre-Series A company, this materially reduces the funding needed to reach ARR milestones.

**Multi-year net margin summary (200-seat Growth example):**

| Contract structure | 3-year gross ACV | 3-year total cost | 3-year gross profit | Blended 3yr GM |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3× annual renewals (undiscounted) | $64,800 | $16,732 | $48,068 | 74.2% |
| 3-year prepay at 25% discount | $48,600 | $14,332 | $34,268 | 70.5% |
| Δ (discount cost to FORM) | −$16,200 ACV | −$2,400 cost | −$13,800 GP | −3.7 pp |

**The customer receives a $16,200 discount over 3 years; FORM gives up $13,800 in gross profit but eliminates ~$32,400 of churn-exposure ARR.** On a cohort basis, multi-year contracts are the correct offer for accounts where Year 2 expansion is expected (i.e., the pilot showed >50% seat utilisation at M3). Offer 3-year proactively on Growth and Enterprise tiers to accounts meeting the expansion signal threshold.
